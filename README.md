# LayoutWithRowsOfCategories

Prepared as [MRE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for https://stackoverflow.com/a/79242250/1271826.

Developed using Xcode 16.1 and Swift 5 (though it should work fine with Swift 6, too).

Most of the relevant code is located in [`ViewController`](LayoutWithRowsOfCategories/Views/ViewController.swift).
